Creating a Voice Virtual Assistant with ElevenLabs

How it works:
🎤 The API records the user's voice through the microphone
🖨️ It processes it to know when the user has finished speaking or is interrupting the assistant
🤖 It calls an LLM model to generate a response
📈 It synthesizes the response into speech
🔊 It plays the synthesized speech through the speakers
